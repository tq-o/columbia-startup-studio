# Brand Position Template

**Team Name:**
**Date:**

**Purpose:** This is an internal document. It captures your brand's thesis, identity, and canonical language so that everything you build — landing page, copy, features, pitch — speaks with one voice. This is not marketing copy. It is a decision reference.

---

## Brand Thesis

What is the one-sentence emotional and philosophical anchor of your brand? This is the big idea, not a feature description.

> **[Your brand thesis here]**

---

## Core Product Definition

Complete this sentence with maximum clarity:

> **[Product Name] helps [who] [do what] by [how].**

This should be reusable verbatim anywhere you need to explain what your product does.

---

## Existence Statement

Why does this product exist? Not what it does, but why it needs to be in the world.

> **[Product Name] exists to [purpose].**

---

## Target Identity

Who is your user, described in aspirational but honest terms? Not demographics — identity.

> **[Product Name] is for someone who [identity description].**

Example: "Morsel is for a brand leader who believes customer feedback is a growth engine, not a complaint box."

---

## Canonical Language

List 4-6 phrases that capture your brand voice. These are the words and phrases you use repeatedly across all surfaces.

- **[Phrase 1]**
- **[Phrase 2]**
- **[Phrase 3]**
- **[Phrase 4]**

---

## Language to Avoid

What words or framings are off-brand? What do competitors say that you deliberately don't?

- **Avoid:** [word/phrase] — **Because:** [reason]
- **Avoid:** [word/phrase] — **Because:** [reason]
- **Avoid:** [word/phrase] — **Because:** [reason]

---

## Tone Guidelines

Describe your brand's voice in 3-4 short rules:

- **[Adjective] not [adjective]** — [brief explanation]
- **[Adjective] not [adjective]** — [brief explanation]
- **[Adjective] not [adjective]** — [brief explanation]

Example: "Warm but not saccharine — genuine care without excessive emoji."

---

## Positioning Statement

Complete this sentence:

> **For [target user], [Product Name] is the [category] that [key benefit] because [reason to believe].**

Example: "For brand leaders at growing DTC companies, Morsel is the feedback platform that turns customer voice into product decisions because it captures context traditional surveys miss."

---

## Brand Values

What 2-3 principles guide decisions when the team disagrees? These are tiebreakers, not aspirations.

- **[Value]** — [what it means in practice]
- **[Value]** — [what it means in practice]
- **[Value]** — [what it means in practice]

Example: "Transparency over polish — we'd rather ship something honest than something pretty."

---

## Objection Handling

What did skeptics say in your interviews? What are the top 2-3 reasons someone would say no, and how would you respond?

| Objection | Your Response |
|-----------|--------------|
| "[what they said or would say]" | [how you address it] |
| "[what they said or would say]" | [how you address it] |
| "[what they said or would say]" | [how you address it] |

These feed directly into your landing page. The best copy preempts doubt before the reader has to voice it.

---

## Key Interview Language

Pull the 3-5 most vivid phrases from your interviews that should influence your copy. These are your users' actual words.

1. "[exact quote]" — [context]
2. "[exact quote]" — [context]
3. "[exact quote]" — [context]
