### Class Folder Naming

Class folders follow the pattern: `yyyymmdd_c[n]w[y]_[day]_[topic]/`

- `yyyymmdd` — date of the class
- `c[n]` — class number (1-23)
- `w[y]` — week number
- `[day]` — day of week (tue/thu)
- `[topic]` — brief topic description

**Example:** `20260203_c4w3_tue_team-formation/` is Class 4 in Week 3, on Tuesday Feb 3rd, covering team formation.
