# Copy V2

## Hero
Scroll less without deleting social media.

## Problem
You are not lazy. The feed is engineered to keep you there, and self-imposed blocks fail because you can always remove them.

## Mechanism
NoticeMe adds social accountability for attention: trusted classmates and study peers see lightweight screen-time signals, creating enough pressure to help you exit loops.

## Privacy
You control who sees what. Share categories or top apps, not every detail.

## Proof
Interview pattern: students repeatedly delete apps then reinstall; social visibility is the only approach that felt sustainable.

## Pricing
Free tier + Premium at $5.99/month for deeper trend insights.

## CTA
Start your 7-day reset with your accountability circle.
