## Strategy
Start with highest-conversion, lowest-dealbreaker segments and scale only after quality thresholds hold.

## Segment performance summary (V6)
- privacy_guarded: conversion 83%, dealbreaker 0%
- deletion_rebounder: conversion 58%, dealbreaker 8%
- self_control_fatigued: conversion 50%, dealbreaker 0%
- skeptical_optimizer: conversion 33%, dealbreaker 8%
- social_motivated: conversion 33%, dealbreaker 8%

## Expansion ladder with budget thresholds
1. Launch top two segments with 70% budget and exact-match intent keywords.
2. Add next two segments when 7-day CPA is at/under target and trial quality is stable.
3. Expand to broad and remarketing when trial-to-paid quality remains stable for two weeks.

## Campaign setup
- Type: Search first, then PMax for creative exploration
- Bidding: Maximize Conversions -> tCPA after stable volume
- Networks: Search only initially
- Locations: US campus-heavy metros

## Conversion tracking
- Primary: trial_start
- Secondary: onboarding_complete, day7_return

## Ad extensions from copy
- Sitelinks: How it works, Privacy controls, Pricing, FAQ
- Callouts: Scroll less without deleting, Social accountability, Privacy controls

## Negative keywords
- free screen time wallpaper
- parental control app
- phone detox retreat

## Post-launch optimization playbook
- Refresh RSA assets by strongest-line frequency from synthetic findings
- Pause terms/ad groups with persistent privacy objections until copy addresses them
- Reallocate budget weekly toward segments with lower dealbreaker rates
