  "exec_summary": "NoticeMe messaging improved consistently from baseline to V6, with stronger resonance and intent once copy clarified social accountability (not blocking) and explicit privacy controls.",
  "findings": "<ul><li><strong>Core framing worked</strong>: \"scroll less without deleting\" significantly improved resonance.</li><li><strong>Mechanism clarity mattered</strong>: explicit contrast vs blockers reduced skepticism.</li><li><strong>Residual objections remain</strong>: privacy granularity and evidence depth are still requested.</li></ul>",
  "recommendations": "<ol><li><strong>Add privacy module near CTA</strong>: include friend-level visibility examples.</li><li><strong>Add lightweight proof section</strong>: include pilot metrics and retention signal.</li><li><strong>Keep tone playful-not-punitive</strong>: avoid shame-heavy language in hero and proof.</li></ol>",
  "qualitative_themes": "<ul><li><strong>Realism over willpower</strong>: users trust social nudges more than hard blockers.</li><li><strong>Trust controls adoption</strong>: privacy clarity strongly influences willingness to try.</li><li><strong>Peer context is leverage</strong>: accountability value rises with trusted-friend groups.</li></ul>",
