# **Brand Position**

Team Name: 4CUz

Date: February 19, 2026

Purpose: This is an internal document. It captures your brand's thesis, identity, and canonical language so that everything you build — landing page, copy, features, pitch — speaks with one voice. This is not marketing copy. It is a decision reference.

---

## **Brand Thesis**

What is the one-sentence emotional and philosophical anchor of your brand? This is the big idea, not a feature description.

Young people don’t struggle with productivity — they struggle with self-control, momentum, and social accountability in an environment engineered to capture attention.

---

## **Core Product Definition**

Complete this sentence with maximum clarity:

NoticeMe helps students reduce unintentional scrolling by creating social accountability around screen time.

This should be reusable verbatim anywhere you need to explain what your product does.

---

## **Existence Statement**

Why does this product exist? Not what it does, but why it needs to be in the world.

NoticeMe exists to make attention visible and socially accountable so people can align how they spend time with how they want to live.

---

## **Target Identity**

Who is your user, described in aspirational but honest terms? Not demographics — identity.

NoticeMe is for someone who knows they scroll too much, has tried to stop, but wants to change without deleting social media or relying on pure willpower.

Example: "Morsel is for a brand leader who believes customer feedback is a growth engine, not a complaint box."

---

## **Canonical Language**

List 4-6 phrases that capture your brand voice. These are the words and phrases you use repeatedly across all surfaces.

* “Social accountability for attention”  
* “Scroll less without deleting”  
* “Self-control is easier together”  
* “Make your time visible”  
* “A little pressure, not punishment”

---

## **Language to Avoid**

What words or framings are off-brand? What do competitors say that you deliberately don't?

* Avoid: “Productivity app” — Because users framed problem emotionally, not productivity-first.  
* Avoid: “Blocking” / “restriction” — Because repeated pushback that self-imposed blocks are removed.  
* Avoid: “Education feed replacement” — Because users consistently said educational content cannot replace fun content.

---

## **Tone Guidelines**

Describe your brand's voice in 3-4 short rules:

* Insightful not preachy — Users already know the problem  
* Playful not punitive — Shame must be light, not harsh  
* Empowering not controlling — Avoid language of enforcement

Example: "Warm but not saccharine — genuine care without excessive emoji."

---

## **Positioning Statement**

Complete this sentence:

For students who want to spend less time scrolling but don’t want to delete social media, NoticeMe is the social accountability app that reduces unintentional screen time because it makes attention visible among peers.

Example: "For brand leaders at growing DTC companies, Morsel is the feedback platform that turns customer voice into product decisions because it captures context traditional surveys miss."

---

## **Brand Values**

What 2-3 principles guide decisions when the team disagrees? These are tiebreakers, not aspirations.

* Behavioral realism over idealism — Assume users will bypass limits; design around it  
* Social motivation over individual discipline — Evidence shows social features most appealing  
* Low friction over enforcement — Abrasive controls cause deletion

Example: "Transparency over polish — we'd rather ship something honest than something pretty."

---

## **Objection Handling**

What did skeptics say in your interviews? What are the top 2-3 reasons someone would say no, and how would you respond?

| Objection | Your Response |
| ----- | ----- |
| “You’re the one creating the block and the one who can take it down.” | We don’t rely on self-control mechanisms — instead we create social visibility that changes behavior passively. |
| “People would just delete it.” | Deletion risk is real — the product must feel like a social game, not a restriction tool. |
| “I wouldn’t share my data.” | Granular privacy controls (e.g., share only categories or top apps) preserve autonomy while enabling accountability. |

These feed directly into your landing page. The best copy preempts doubt before the reader has to voice it.

---

## **Key Interview Language**

Pull the 3-5 most vivid phrases from your interviews that should influence your copy. These are your users' actual words.

1. “It doesn’t feel like a lot because it’s on my own time.” — Problem is contextual, not absolute   
2. “I would know the password, so it just wouldn’t work.” — Self-imposed control failure   
3. “I’ve tried deleting, but then I end up redownloading it.” — Deletion is unsustainable   
4. “You start scrolling, you lose the work you’re doing.” — Momentum loss framing   
5. “I think it would — there’s like a shame factor.” — Social pressure works
