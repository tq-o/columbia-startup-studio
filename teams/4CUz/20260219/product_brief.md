**The Problem**

Students know they spend too much time scrolling but struggle to reduce usage without deleting social media or relying on willpower.

* Who has this problem?  
  * College and graduate students who use social media daily for entertainment, connection, and procrastination.

* How do they currently deal with it?

  * Deleting apps temporarily

  * Using screen time limits or blocking apps

  * Putting phones away physically

  * Switching to other devices

  * Trying to self-regulate

* How painful is it? (What evidence do you have from interviews?)

  * Interviewees consistently described momentum loss, sleep disruption, and difficulty stopping once scrolling begins. Multiple participants noted deleting apps but later redownloading them, showing persistent unmet need.

**The Solution**

We are building NoticeMe, a social accountability layer for screen time.

NoticeMe helps students reduce unintentional scrolling by making attention visible within a peer group. Users connect with friends and view lightweight screen time signals, creating social awareness that influences behavior without blocking apps.

Unlike current solutions, NoticeMe does not rely on restrictions or willpower — it uses social visibility to shape habits passively.

**Target User**

* Demographics:   
  * College and graduate students (18–26), campus environments, heavy smartphone users  
* Defining behavior:   
  * Uses social media multiple hours daily  
  * Has attempted to reduce usage at least once  
  * Continues using social media despite intention to cut back  
* How they describe the problem:  
  * “It doesn’t feel like a lot because it’s on my own time.”  
  * “I’ve tried deleting, but then I end up redownloading it.”  
  * “You start scrolling, you lose the work you’re doing.”

**Why Now**

Several conditions make this problem newly salient:

* Increasing awareness of attention economy harms  
* Social media usage remaining high despite self-awareness  
* Peer comparison already normalized through apps (fitness, academics, etc.)  
* Technical ability to surface screen time signals social

Together, these create an opportunity for a social behavior layer rather than a control tool.

**Key Interview Evidence**  
Summarize the strongest signals from your interviews:

* Strongest quote:  
  * “I’ve tried deleting, but then I end up redownloading it.”  
* Pattern:  
  * Self-imposed controls are ineffective because users can bypass or remove them.  
* Surprise:  
  * Screen time was framed more as an emotional/self-control problem than a productivity problem.  
* Current spend/effort:  
  * Users invest effort through deletion, app limits, and behavioral workarounds but rarely pay for solutions.

**Open Questions**

1. How strong does social accountability need to be to influence behavior without triggering avoidance?  
2. What level of data sharing feels acceptable across different friend groups?  
3. Which social mechanics (leaderboards, streaks, comparisons) produce sustained engagement?
