# Problem-Solution Pairs

## Problem-Solution Pair 1

**Context:** First-year medical resident on transit using a smartwatch, reviewing critical notes between stops before a presentation.

1. **Problem:** Tiny screen makes dense medical notes hard to scan quickly
   **Why it matters:** Limited screen space forces scrolling through critical information when every second counts.
   **Solution:** AI-powered "critical highlights" that condense notes into key bullet points optimized for smartwatch display
   **Pain likelihood:** 9/10

2. **Problem:** Limited time between stops causes missed important details
   **Why it matters:** Short transit windows make comprehensive review nearly impossible.
   **Solution:** Smart vibration alerts when approaching high-priority sections or deadlines
   **Pain likelihood:** 8/10

3. **Problem:** Hard to retain info while distracted by commuting environment
   **Why it matters:** Noise and movement reduce focus and retention during critical review.
   **Solution:** Quick voice recap mode that reads summaries through earbuds
   **Pain likelihood:** 8/10

4. **Problem:** Manual scrolling wastes precious seconds
   **Why it matters:** Every second spent navigating is time not spent learning.
   **Solution:** Gesture-based navigation (tilt wrist to move sections, tap to expand)
   **Pain likelihood:** 7/10

5. **Problem:** Notes aren't tailored to what's likely to be asked in presentations
   **Why it matters:** Generic notes don't prepare for specific question types.
   **Solution:** Presentation-focused summary mode pulling likely Q&A topics and clinical pearls
   **Pain likelihood:** 8/10


## Problem-Solution Pair 2

**Context:** University professor in an office using a tablet, reviewing submissions and comparing student performance patterns.

1. **Problem:** Takes too long to spot trends across many student assignments
   **Why it matters:** Manual review of dozens of submissions makes identifying patterns extremely time-consuming.
   **Solution:** Visual performance dashboards showing strengths, weaknesses, and progress over time
   **Pain likelihood:** 9/10

2. **Problem:** Inconsistent grading due to fatigue and volume
   **Why it matters:** Grading 50+ assignments leads to drift in standards and fairness concerns.
   **Solution:** AI-assisted rubric scoring with explanation previews
   **Pain likelihood:** 9/10

3. **Problem:** Hard to identify struggling students early
   **Why it matters:** By the time problems are obvious, intervention is often too late.
   **Solution:** Automated alerts for sudden performance drops or missed patterns
   **Pain likelihood:** 8/10

4. **Problem:** Switching between files disrupts workflow
   **Why it matters:** Context switching slows grading and increases cognitive load.
   **Solution:** Split-screen comparison mode for side-by-side submissions
   **Pain likelihood:** 7/10

5. **Problem:** Feedback takes longer than grading itself
   **Why it matters:** Writing personalized comments for each student is extremely time-intensive.
   **Solution:** Smart feedback generator suggesting personalized comments professors can tweak
   **Pain likelihood:** 8/10


## Problem-Solution Pair 3

**Context:** Early-stage startup founder working from home on a laptop, tracking candidates and iterating on role descriptions.

1. **Problem:** Too many resumes with unclear fit for fast-changing roles
   **Why it matters:** Startup needs evolve rapidly, making static resume screening ineffective.
   **Solution:** Skill-matching engine that scores candidates against evolving job needs
   **Pain likelihood:** 9/10

2. **Problem:** Role descriptions become outdated quickly as startup pivots
   **Why it matters:** Misaligned job descriptions attract wrong candidates and waste time.
   **Solution:** Dynamic JD builder that updates based on current projects and gaps
   **Pain likelihood:** 8/10

3. **Problem:** Hard to compare candidates across soft skills and growth potential
   **Why it matters:** Early hires need adaptability, not just current skill match.
   **Solution:** Candidate profile heatmaps combining experience, adaptability, and learning speed
   **Pain likelihood:** 8/10

4. **Problem:** Interview notes get messy and forgotten
   **Why it matters:** Scattered notes across docs/emails make decision-making difficult.
   **Solution:** Centralized interview insight tracker with automatic summaries
   **Pain likelihood:** 7/10

5. **Problem:** Time wasted filtering unqualified applicants
   **Why it matters:** Small teams can't afford to spend hours on clearly unfit candidates.
   **Solution:** Smart pre-screening tasks or mini challenges tied to real startup work
   **Pain likelihood:** 8/10
