# Lean Canvas 1: Medical Resident – AI-powered Critical Highlights on Smartwatch

## Problem
**Top 3 Problems:**
- Tiny smartwatch screens make dense medical notes hard to scan quickly
- Residents have limited time between stops and presentations to retain key info
- Cognitive overload from trying to recall important points on the move

**Existing Alternatives:**
- Phone note apps (too slow to access)
- Paper notes (not portable/searchable)
- Memory alone (unreliable under pressure)

## Solution
**Key Features:**
- AI-powered summarization of notes into concise, bullet-point "critical highlights"
- Smartwatch-friendly display with swipe/scroll gestures
- Optional voice reading mode for hands-free review
- One-tap access from watch face

## Unique Value Proposition
"Get the key insights from your medical notes in seconds, anytime, anywhere—optimized for your wrist."

## Customer Segments
**Target Users:**
- First-year medical residents and interns who commute or have limited prep time
- Busy clinicians needing mobile access to critical notes

**Early Adopters:**
- Tech-savvy residents who commute and use smartwatches

## Unfair Advantage
- Tailored for medical workflows and small-screen wearables
- AI models trained specifically on clinical note data
- Deep integration with hospital systems

## Channels
- Integration with hospital note systems (Epic, Cerner)
- Mobile app stores for smartwatch apps (Apple Watch, Wear OS)
- Residency program recommendations/partnerships
- Medical education conferences

## Revenue Streams
- Subscription model for individual residents ($5–$10/month)
- Enterprise/hospital licensing for residency programs

## Cost Structure
- AI summarization model development and fine-tuning
- Smartwatch app design, UX, and ongoing updates
- Cloud storage for note processing
- HIPAA compliance and security

## Key Metrics
- Daily active users and engagement per session
- Average time saved per note
- User satisfaction and recall improvement
- Retention rate

## Assumptions to Validate
- Residents are willing to pay or hospitals will license a subscription
- AI can reliably extract clinically relevant points from notes
- Users will adopt a smartwatch-first workflow for prep

# Lean Canvas 2: University Professor – AI-assisted Rubric Scoring with Explanations

## Problem
**Top 3 Problems:**
- Inconsistent grading due to fatigue, volume, and subjective interpretation of rubrics
- Feedback quality suffers when professors rush through large numbers of submissions
- Time pressure makes thorough grading nearly impossible

**Existing Alternatives:**
- Manual grading (slow, inconsistent)
- TA help (expensive, variable quality)
- Simple auto-graders (can't handle subjective work)
- Peer review (unreliable)

## Solution
**Key Features:**
- AI analyzes student submissions and scores them against rubric criteria
- Generates explanation previews for each score
- Professors can adjust scores and explanations before finalizing
- Consistency tracking across graders

## Unique Value Proposition
"Grade smarter, not harder: AI-assisted scoring that saves time and ensures consistent, fair evaluations."

## Customer Segments
**Target Users:**
- University professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants grading large classes
- Academic institutions looking to standardize grading quality

**Early Adopters:**
- Professors teaching 100+ student courses with essay/project components

## Unfair Advantage
- Explains reasoning behind suggested grades; not just a black-box score
- Can adapt to different rubrics and course types
- Deep LMS integrations

## Channels
- Integration with learning management systems (Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle)
- Academic conferences, teaching workshops, or pilot programs
- Direct email campaigns to universities and departments

## Revenue Streams
- SaaS subscription for institutions ($50–$200 per professor per semester)
- Pay-per-course or per-student licensing model

## Cost Structure
- AI model training on diverse assignments and rubrics
- LMS integrations and ongoing maintenance
- Customer support and onboarding
- Platform hosting

## Key Metrics
- Reduction in grading time per assignment
- Consistency score improvements across graders
- Adoption rate per course or department
- Professor satisfaction (NPS)

## Assumptions to Validate
- AI can reliably score subjective assignments with useful explanations
- Professors are willing to trust AI for grading support
- Institutions will pay for a tool that partially automates grading

# Lean Canvas 3: Startup Founder – Skill-Matching Engine for Candidates

## Problem
**Top 3 Problems:**
- Too many resumes with unclear fit for fast-changing roles
- Early-stage startups can't afford hiring mistakes or long recruitment cycles

**Existing Alternatives:**
- Manual resume review (slow, subjective)
- LinkedIn Recruiter (expensive, generic)
- Traditional ATS (built for large companies)
- Recruiting agencies (very expensive)

## Solution
**Key Features:**
- AI engine scores candidates against dynamic role descriptions and startup-specific skill needs
- Continuously updates scoring as roles and responsibilities evolve
- Candidate profile heatmaps combining experience, adaptability, and learning speed
- Dynamic JD builder

## Unique Value Proposition
"Find the right candidate faster: AI-powered skill-matching for your evolving startup needs."

## Customer Segments
**Target Users:**
- Early-stage startup founders, HR managers, and recruiting teams in dynamic companies
- Small companies with limited time/resources to evaluate candidates

**Early Adopters:**
- Pre-seed to Series A founders

- Customer retention (monthly churn)

## Assumptions to Validate
- AI can accurately match candidates to roles in small, evolving teams
- Founders are willing to pay for AI-assisted recruitment
- Sufficient data exists to train a predictive skill-match model for early-stage startups
